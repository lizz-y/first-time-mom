    <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
    <p><strong>Hi, I'm Elizabeth!</strong> A first-time mom turned community builder. When I had my son in 2025, I quickly realized how overwhelming motherhood could feel - even with Google and Instagram. I created First Time Mama to make sure no mom feels alone, and every mom feels supported, seen, and empowered.</p>
